# Taterr - Table Tennis Round Robin - Tournament Generator

This is a work in progress! 

## Notes to Self
- Sort by USATT rating and group 'em together
- Group component should have title: Group 1, 2, etc
- Might need a "make new group" button
- Use React drag n drop for the ability to drag people from one group to the other
- Upon clicking Generate button then we will see the generated round robin formatting in a print-friendly fashion


## Aspirational Instructions
1. Upload XLSX file in the correct format, name in one column and USATT rating in the other
2. Drag and drop to modify groupings
3. Click Generate button to create the groupings in a print-friendly view
